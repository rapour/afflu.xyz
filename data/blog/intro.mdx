I tend to forget things so easily. For a long, I have been thinking about ways to retain ideas 
and solutions I came upon here and there and revolve around my work and life. Writing them down 
was always a good choice. This blog is an attempt to take a step forward. Having a blog is great 
since not only will I have an access to my materials, but others will also be able to make use of 
them if they encounter similar challenges. Additionally, having a digital footprint feels right. 
The idea of having an audience is exciting. I hope I will get the opportunity to have feedback on 
the material posted on this blog. That will give me a chance to refine my thoughts and get rid of 
the foolish ones.
